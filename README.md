Still working on this one, getting input from a NeuroSky MindWave Mobile.

So far, the project relies on the tcpClient external Java class, found here: http://cycling74.com/toolbox/tcpclient/

Connects via TGSP, more here: http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_socket_protocol

Current bug, need to lead MindWave Mobile Tutorial before ThinkGearConnect will output data, likely missing authorization request from Max.
